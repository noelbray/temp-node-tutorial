You can install globally devDependencies or dependencies that you want every app you create to be able to access such as nodemon.

You can install it in your terminal or you can do it in the integrated terminal; it doesn't really matter which fo these you install it at, with.

When it comes to global packages, you can install it from anywhere. 

npm install -g <package-name>

ex: npm install -g nodemon

It installs it in a location, I believe, that npm chose/specified.

To find out where the "global packages are installed" run this command: 

npm config get prefix 

which yielded for me: 

C:\Users\noelw\AppData\Roaming\npm
