Express JS:

Minimalist web framework for Node.JS

It's not built into Node JS but it is pretty much a standard.

npm install express --save

--save is not needed anymore, but you can use --save if you want to, it wont hurt anything.

When you run "npm install express" you will get the latest version on, from npm.

To install a certain version of a package: 

npm install <pkg-name>@<pkg-version-number> --save

E.g.: npm install express@4.17.1 --save
