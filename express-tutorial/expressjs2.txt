Use Express in 2 Ways:

1. to setup API

    - API in this case means to setup up an 'http interface to interact with our data."

    - data is sent in JSON (Javscript Object Notation)

    - res.json() will do all the heavy lifting.

    - The server provides data, any content app simply accesses the data and servers it.

    - Were responsible for setting up the user interface and sending back the data.

2. to setup templates with SSR

    - set up templates
    
    - send back the templates

    - res.render() will take care of this
